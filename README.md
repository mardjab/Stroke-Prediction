# Stroke prediction

A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, mainly due to
blockage or rupture of an artery, which then prevents brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 3rd leading cause of disability
globally, and responsible for approximately 11% of global deaths. In the United States alone, nearly
800,000 people suffer from a stroke every year, with about three in four being firstâ€‘time strokes. And
since strokes can be prevented in about 80% of the time, educating the general population on stroke
signs is paramount.
The objective of this study was to build a model for predicting the likelihood of having a stroke based
on several clinical inputs (such as age, disease and smoking status).
